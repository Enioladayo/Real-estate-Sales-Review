# Real-estate-Sales-Review

### Project overview

This analysis project aims to provide valuable insights to intending investors into the Connecticut Real Estate, focusing on 10 major cities identifying individual features of the top five Towns and reviewing how each town performed in the first to third quarter of 2022.

### Data Sources

The primary data set used for this analysis is the “Real_Estate_Sales_2001-2022_GL.csv” file, containing relevant information about Connecticut real estate sales from 2001 to 2022. After some cleaning, the “real_estate_2022_to_tableau.csv” file was loaded into Tableau for creating report. 

### Tools

Excel – Data Cleaning
Tableau – Creating reports


### Data cleaning /preparation

In the initial preparation phase, I performed the following tasks;
- Data loading and inspection
- Handling missing values
- Data cleaning and formatting

### Explorative Data Analysis

EDA involved exploring the sales data to answer key questions, such as;
1.	What is the overall sales trend?
2.	What is the monthly sales trend?
3.	Which property type is the best seller?
4.	What are the peak sales periods?

### Results/findings

- Stamford is the best performing town in terms of sales and known for the following features; Good economic standing, low crime rate, availability of abundant educational, recreational and health facilities, close proximity to New York city, constant construction activities
- Bridgeport is the most populated town with the largest community in Connecticut but experiences low sales as there is reportedly high crime rate but still considered relatively affordable.
- Darien is considered the most expensive neighborhood, which presents a high standard of living.
- Overall sales was highest in June but 50% of this major towns were at their highest in August.

### Recommendations

1.	Leverage the features of each town to drive sales and know the type of buildings that will sell in each town. 
2.	Take a closer look into August sales to find strategies to ensure sales is always at its peak in a large percentage of the State


### Limitations
- The original data set was incomplete with the exclusion of the 4th quarter.
- Data of some major towns like Greenwich was missing
